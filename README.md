New leds and firmware for glowing ball based on ATtiny13 microcontroller.  
No Arduino framework or lins were used because of low amount of microcontroller's memory.  
RGBW Neo-Pixel compaible led strip was used.  

~~Light slowly goes from red to green to blue while pulses with white.~~  
Slowly change colors started from one side, while maintain max possible brightness  

Based on https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny13-NeoController
