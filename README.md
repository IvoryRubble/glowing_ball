New leds and firmware for glowing ball based on ATtiny13 microcontroller.  
No Arduino framework or lins were used because of low amount of microcontroller's memory.  
RGBW Neo-Pixel compaible led strip was used.  
Light slowly goes from red to green to blue while pulses with white.  
Based on https://github.com/wagiminator/ATtiny13-NeoController
